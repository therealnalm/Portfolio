  <b
    >Has the number of owner-occupied units decreased, or has the corporate
    ownership rate increased mostly from the purchase of newer units/housing for
    a growing population?</b
  >
</p>
<p>
  I’m curious to understand if families/individuals that have/would have
  historically owned (and occupied) their properties have been able to maintain
  ownership and/or pass property down through their family or if the market has
  taken such a dramatic direction that people who would have traditionally been
  owner-occupiers have given up ownership. From another lens, is the housing
  market’s inability to keep up with a growing population the main proponent of
  corporate ownership or is the rise in private equity and other real estate
  investment channels strong enough that it has pushed people out of ownership?
  I’m curious if there is an equity angle where only new homebuyers have been
  pushed out or if previous homeowners have also suffered.

    >How have different neighborhoods been affected by corporate ownership over
    time?</b
  >
</p>
<p>
  Although it’s clear (and unsurprising) that housing speculation has had the
  greatest effect in lower income neighborhoods, I’m curious if other
  neighborhoods have seen the same trends on a time-delayed basis or if the
  lower income neighborhoods have simply been affected more. Conversely, as
  investor ownership of property has grown in less-advantaged communities, has
  it saturated the market and flowed over into other areas or does there not
  seem to be an end in sight?
</p>

<p>
  <b>Who owns property across neighborhoods of different demographics</b
  ><b>?</b>
</p>
<p>
  Home ownership in the US has historically been disproportionately attained by
  white Americans. Given that Boston is a racially diverse city with specific
  neighborhoods often being more racially homogeneous, I’m curious to see if
  there is any relationship between property ownership and the demographics of
  different neighborhoods. This question was spurred from the MAPC reports
  statistics on how speculation has affected different demographics.
</p>

<h1 id="explorationandinsights">Exploration and Insights</h1>

<p>
  To begin answering the first question, I calculated a new field to determine
  the number of owner occupied units corresponding with each year.
</p>
<figure>
  <img src="../images/5fr_Image_1.png" alt="Number of owner occupied units" />
</figure>
<p>
  This graph shows the total number of owner occupied units (tot unit * Own Occ
  Rate) in Boston from 2004 to 2024. It shows an 11% decrease over 20 years
  which indicates that even accounting for population growth and new
  construction, the amount of owner occupied units is decreasing numerically
  before taking into account a growing population and housing stock. Next, I’d
  like to explore how this phenomenon manifested in different neighborhoods.
</p>

<figure>
  <img
    src="../images/yFO_Image_2.png"
    alt="Number of owner occupied units per neighborhood"
  />
</figure>
<p>
  This graph displays the number of owner occupied units each year per
  neighborhood. At first glance, what stands out is the “flatness” of the lines
  and Dorchester being an outlier in magnitude. The flatness would show a more
  constant number of owner occupied units. Dorchester, for example, only
  experienced a 4% decrease over 20 years. That said, this effect is balanced
  out by other neighborhoods like Alston which experienced a 24% decrease. Also
  notable is South Boston Waterfront (Seaport) which experienced a 20% increase
  in owner occupied units, likely due to the massive developments built there
  during this time. At a glance, a 20% increase in owner occupied units within a
  region that probably doubled or tripled the total number of units seems
  surprisingly low and warrants more investigation. Upon further inspection, I
  also noticed that the number of owner occupied units in Dorchester flatlines
  between 2013 and 2020 at 23,023 units (.48 ooc rate * 47,965 units), which
  seems highly unrealistic. Since the owner occupied rate is rounded to 2
  decimal places over 1000’s of units, it's possible that the rate did not
  change, but it is improbable the the total number of units would have also
  remained constant for 7 years. Similar abnormalities exist elsewhere, like
  West Roxbury from 2015 to 2021. To further explore this, I decided to look
  into the total number of units in Boston.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="../images/tio_Image_3.png" alt="Total units in Boston" />
</figure>

<p>
  The following graph should show the total number of units available in Boston
  over the period in question. Although the bad news is it is also flatlined at
  282,190 units, it means we found our problem in the data! Just to be sure, I
  checked the data at a neighborhood level.
</p>

<p>
  This graph of total number of units in Boston at the neighborhood level
  confirms the issue. A cross check with
  <a
    href="https://www.bostonplans.org/getattachment/c55502f3-3a70-4772-a894-0c51c325b216#:~:text=Boston%20had%20301%2C702%20total%20housing,were%20vacant%20in%20April%202020."
    >data from the 2 most recent census</a
  >
  shows that there were 272,481 units in 2010 and 301,702 units in 2020,
  indicating that the 282,190 units were likely either the housing from an
  intermediate year (2014?) or the average number of housing units over the 20
  years.
</p>

</figure>

<p>
  Further direct inspection of the data (pictured left) shows that only the
  own_occ and corp_own fields are specific by year, with all other census fields
  held constant. Interestingly, these fields are selectively different from the
  <a
    href="https://data.boston.gov/dataset/2020-census-for-boston/resource/5800a0a2-6acd-41a3-9fe0-1bf7b038750d"
    >data linked as the “source”</a
  >
  in the file’s metadata (pictured right). Allston has different numbers while
  Beacon Hill is the same.
</p>

<p>
  Nonetheless, this all shows that this dataset is not usable for any
  time-related statistics or graphs, except in relation to owner occupancy rate
  and corporate ownership rate. Fortunately the 2nd question only relies on that
  data, and the 3rd question can be roughly answered without year-specific data
  under the assumption that racial demographics of Boston’s neighborhoods have
  not undergone any dramatic changes over the past 20 years. That said, since
  the data to properly answer that question is available elsewhere, I’ll focus
  on answering the 2nd question.
</p>

<p>
  To address the second question, I began by assessing the spatial quality of
  the data provided in tableau, using 2024 and 2004 as reference points.
</p>
<figure>
  <img
    src="../images/xk1_Image_7.png"
    alt="Corporate ownership in Boston 2024"
  />
  <img
    src="../images/0zg_Image_8.png"
    alt="Corporate ownership in Boston 2024"
  />
</figure>
<p>
  The maps show the corporate ownership rate of properties throughout Boston in
  2004 and 2024. That said, the dividing lines are confusing since many of the
  regions that are displayed as divided represent the same data. Additionally, 2
  pieces of land around Back Bay and Northeastern are not included. Nonetheless,
  it shows some clear trends about corporate ownership. First: corp. ownership
  is higher in the parts of Boston that are further North. Specifically,
  Downtown and Seaport exhibit the highest rates of corporate ownership. This
  makes sense, given that they are both business districts with a lot of office
  space and high rises. It’s also worth noting that Allston and Downtown were
  the areas with the highest corporate ownership in 2004 and continued to have
  some of the highest rates in 2024. I was unable to discern what the
  unknown/null values were although I did exclude them for the following maps.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="../images/TR2_Image_9.png" alt="Corporate Ownership Delta" />
</figure>
<p>
  This map shows the delta between corporate ownership between 2004 to 2024 by
  neighborhood. Based on the assertions from the MAPC that more speculation
  occurs in low-income, non-white neighborhoods, which I understood are usually
  in the more southern parts of Boston, I was surprised that corporate ownership
  was higher in more northern areas. That said, it makes sense that Seaport
  would have the highest Delta given the rapid influx of large-scale, high-end
  development over the past 20 years. Overall, it seems possible that the
  highest deltas are in the neighborhoods that have experienced the most
  development over the past 20 years.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="../images/rLV_Image_10.png" alt="Owner occupied unit rate 2004" />
  <img src="../images/t0R_Image_11.png" alt="Owner occupied unit rate 2024" />
</figure>
<p>
  These maps show the owner occupied unit rate throughout Boston in 2004 and
  2024. Somewhat unsurprisingly, they present as a slight inverse to the maps of
  corporate ownership rate in Boston. This makes sense, given that corporate
  owned units and owner occupied units are largely mutually exclusive.
  Interestingly, the two maps are relatively similar and do not seem to show
  much of a change in occupant ownership. Again, somewhat contradictory to what
  might have been implied by the MAPC report, it seems that Boston’s most
  diverse neighborhoods have higher home ownership rates than the less diverse
  neighborhoods.
</p>
<figure>
  <img src="../images/Lyx_Image_12.png" alt="Owner occupied rate delta" />
</figure>
<p>
  This map shows the change in owner occupied unit rate in Boston between 2004
  and 2024. This map paints a very different picture than would have been
  expected from the corporate ownership delta map. The changes are much smaller
  than would have been expected. Whereas I may have assumed a somewhat direct
  converse relationship between corporate ownership rate and owner occupant
  rate, their change does not appear to be correlated. The gap between high
  corporate ownership increases compared to smaller owner occupancy rate
  decreases, would likely point to one of two things. First, the two statistics
  do not refer to the same sum whole. The meta-data does not state that the
  statistics refer to the same source data. Second, and perhaps more likely, is
  that there are other ownership groups. Non-corporate, non-occupying owners
  make up a significant portion of property owners. Their ownership rate would
  fill the delta between the other 2 figures. This would indicate that these
  owners are likely the ones selling their properties to corporate owners.
</p>

<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>

<p>
  I first discovered that this dataset is not reliable to answer questions
  related to annual changes in population or housing supply in Boston, but only
  accurate for data relating to owner occupation rates and corporate ownership
  rates of units in Boston. Second, there is a loose inverse relationship
  between rates of owner occupation and corporate ownership of units in Boston,
  although the 2 don’t necessarily maintain that relationship linearly over
  time. Lastly, surprisingly it seems that the wealthier parts of Boston seem to
  have higher rates of corporate ownership and lower rates of owner occupancy
  while less wealthy (and more diverse) parts of Boston seem to have lower
  corporate ownership rates and higher owner occupancy rates. This seems to run
  contrary to what was reported in the MAPC piece.
