  The data visualization used in Shaman’s article to represent covid cases
  effectively uses width to represent new cases over time, although puts a twist
  on traditional line representations by adding an angular component to
  represent time. Although I appreciated the attempt to make same-month data
  comparable by placing them at the same angle, it comes at a great sacrifice
  for accuracy of the visualization. Since a common width (not area) correlates
  to case count, a graph representing a constant caseload will have a constantly
  increasing area, so an equivalent caseload in 2021 appears larger than 2020.
  This has the (perhaps intended) effect of making the December 2022 outbreak
  appear proportionally larger or scarier than that of 2021. It nicely
  complemented the article that stated that Omicron should be taken seriously,
  although it did so in a slightly misleading way.
</p>

<p>
  The visualization’s placement directly below the title of the article is
  somewhat confusing. There is an implication that the visual will show “when we
  expect Omicron” to peak although it merely indicates an increase in cases.
  Although a first glance is sufficient to convey the data being represented,
  the unorthodox layout feels like it requires further inspection to understand.
  Red is a good color choice to convey that more cases are negative. The choice
  to use a width that extends to both sides of the centerline creates a sloppy
  effect where there are 2 squiggly lines instead of 1 around the centerline.
  This detracts from the professionality of the visualization and draws more
  questions as to if there’s another facet to the data being represented.
  Lastly, the 7-day average point should be made in the “key” where the 150k
  cases are labeled so readers don’t have to look in multiple places for
  information that should be in the key.

<ul>
  <li>Chose to stack year lines vertically for ease of comparison</li>
  <li>
    Used a traditional linear representation without angular component to make
    years more directly comparable
  </li>
  <li>
    Used the daily average new cases per month to reduce complexity, ultimately
    this over-muted the data to the point that it is somewhat misleading and
    under represents the severity of spikes
  </li>
  <li>
    Experimented with black and white only color scheme to simplify, but I think
    that it could have benefited from added color (probably red or maybe a dark
    orange to be red-adjacent without directly correlating to death)
  </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Fig 2</b></p>

</figure>

<ul>
  <li>
    Wanted to focus on identifying where the peaks were, so chose to show each
    month’s max daily new cases
  </li>
  <li>
    Increased focus on being able to compare similar periods of time so put the
    months from each year directly next to each other
  </li>
  <li>
    Chose 3 similar shades of brown/yellow/orange for years to still give a
    slightly alert or even negative feel to cases without seeming to preference
    any one year
  </li>
  <li>
    Was initially disappointed at the disparity between early 2020 data being 0
    and late 2022 data not being included, so included a starred note in the key
    and added stars where the late 2022 data would be and bolded lines at 0 for
    early 2020 data. I think that communicated those outliers really well.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ultimately, I didn’t like the choice to display max daily cases from each
    month as it (like the averages) does not convey the entire story
  </li>
  <li>
    I did like the choice to place the key centrally to draw in your attention
    so you read it before actually examining the data.
  </li>
  <li>
    I thought it might be clever to put the axes labels in the bottom left
    corner since they should be relatively self explanatory but it's too much to
    the point of looking sloppy. I think smaller font centered next to their
    axes would have been better
  </li>
  <li>
    I tried again to abbreviate all the months except for January to make it
    cleaner, but I think each month needs at least 3 letters to be easily
    understandable
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    After dancing around and trying to complicate the data display, I decided to
    go with the simplest, most straightforward representation: a line of daily
    cases
  </li>
  <li>
    Although the direct comparisons of each month was lost, I think it was the
    simplest and most direct way to convey the information
  </li>
  <li>
    Unfortunately the actual daily testing is far more volatile (which makes me
    understand why the original uses a 7-day rolling average)
  </li>
  <li>
    Instead of including each month (or day) I used 6 months intervals and used
    Jan + Jun (although Dec + May might have been better for differentiability)
  </li>
  <li>
    I used red since there is no need for colors to act as a facet of the
    information but only to imply cases as bad/deadly
  </li>
  <li>
    I realized that there should be some lighter lines in the background to help
    users understand how high the peaks are since it gets hard to tell as you
    get further away
  </li>
  <li>
    Sometimes simplicity is key, and I think this visualization illustrates that

  The names of the game with this data visualisation are simplicity and
  completeness. I didn’t want any novel or confusing spins like in the original
  visualization nor did I want readers to need to spend more than 2 seconds
  looking at the visual in order to understand it. There is not an intended
  message or direction that users are supposed to take the data. It stands on
  its own for people to read and understand when (and how many people) have been
  testing positive for Covid. The main visually encoded components of the data
  is the line showing how many individuals tested positive for covid on a given
  day. Although the days are not clearly differentiated, the curve/variation of
  the line does an apt job at demonstrating the numbers. The color of the line
  is the only piece that communicates a bit of a message. Each year is closer to
  red and should convey a slight sense of urgency and increased negative effect
  over time. A key or much other description was left out both for lack of need
  and to streamline the visual experience. There is not much variation in font
  size or choice to let users focus on the line showing cases. This is
  intentionally simple.

  The critique by design process was useful. Although at first it opened the
  door for more complex, abstract visualizations using different indicators, I
  ultimately found that removing complexities was the best way to convey
  information. Maybe this was because I didn’t have an agenda or motivation for
  my visualizations, but it felt the most “honest” to leave it unfiltered and
  unbiased. Even still, the article was trying to demonstrate that the Omicron
  wave would be worse because it was timed around 2021’s peak and was already
  off to a stronger start. I think that my visualization still shows this well
  (barring the missing later data) and allows the user to come to that
  conclusion themselves instead of feeling pushed into it or confused by a
  spiral.
