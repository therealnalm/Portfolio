<p>My first question about the data was regarding which officers are receiving complaints to understand if it is a relatively concentrated group (most complaints are directed at the same few officers) or if the complaints are relatively spread out.</p>

<figure><img src="../images/k6d_Image_1.png" alt="Enter image alt description"></figure>
<p>This shows how many complaints each officers has.Scrolling through the data, more than half of officers with complaints have less than 6 and ¾ of officers have less than 13 career complaints whereas less than 10% have >20 career complaints. I also inspected the full data to understand what types of complaints are being made against the most complained-against officers and noticed that they were predominantly “discourtesies” and “abuse of power”</p>

<p>I then used excel to figure out how many cops (y axis) received each number of complaints (x axis) and found that it corroborated that very few cops were receiving a large number of complaints. This made me curious as to how the NYPD responded to these complaints.</p>

<p>This graph shows the same data, split by the findings of the review board. Interestingly, for the cops with higher numbers of complaints, it seems that a relatively small number of complaints are actually validated by the review board.</p>

<p>That said, (although it is not pictured) every single cop receiving only one career complaints was found to be substantiated.</p>

<p>Shown above are sets of cops receiving 3 and 16 complaints each. There appears to be a correlation with higher number of complaints and lower percentages of substantiation of complaints.</p>

<figure><img src="../images/6bv_Image_9.png" alt="Enter image alt description"></figure>
<p>At a broad level, 46% of complaints were unsubstantiated, 29% resulted in exoneration, and only the remaining 25% were substantiated.</p>

<figure><img src="../images/tiQ_Image_10.png" alt="Enter image alt description"></figure>
<p>Digging deeper into the outcomes of substantiated charges, it appears that almost half of those complaints resulted in charges, with another ⅓ resulting in some form of command discipline.</p>
<p>NYP ignores most complaints vs. most NYPD complaints were not substantiated. It appears as if there may not be as much to look into here, so I wanted to investigate how rank affects the complaints officers receive.</p>

<figure><img src="../images/kJ4_Image_11.png" alt="Enter image alt description"></figure>
<p>This bar chart shows how many complaints were received by rank as well as the outcome. Although the ratio of outcomes appears to be similar, I am curious about how the magnitude of complaints received per rank compares to the number of police officers at each rank in NYPD….</p>

<figure><img src="../images/2CA_Image_14.png" alt="Enter image alt description"></figure>
<p>Lastly, this bar chart and pi chart show which complaints were most frequently received. This shows that about 50% of complaints are one of the top 6 most common while the other 113 complaints are far less common.</p>

<h1 id="proposition">Proposition</h1>

<p>There is very little correlation between cops receiving more complaints and having more complaints substantiated.</p>

<figure><img src="../images/pvz_Image_15.png" alt="Enter image alt description"></figure>
<p>This graph shows the number of complaints received by each officer of the NYPD who received a complaint.</p>
<ul><li>Substantiated on the bottom 0</li></ul>
<p>This allows readers to be able to follow the line clearly and allow it to feel dwarfed by the rest of complaints. That said, I’m unsure if the software is correctly representing the relative size</p>
<li>Choice of wording with title and key -2</li></ul>
<p>Without further context/definition on what substantiated means or other includes, the implication is that most complaints are baseless or inaccurate. The title directly calls into question the validity of most of the complaints.</p>
<li>The “slope” and axis choice -2</li></ul>
<p>By putting the maximum number of complaints per officer at 70 leaves most of the chart empty implying that the number of overall complaints is actually relatively low. Additionally, although the number of complaints each officer receives is relatively arbitrary to this point, graphing it in a descending order implies that somehow it is lessening.</p>
<li>Colors 0</li></ul>
<p>Choosing gray for “other” complaints gives an implication that they shouldn’t be counted or are somehow extraneous whilst the orange for substantiated claims does allow some importance to these claims.</p>

<figure><img src="../images/2bO_Image_16.png" alt="Enter image alt description"></figure>

<ul><li>Inclusion of <b>“</b>Case studies” -2</li></ul>
<p>Both of these cases were cherry-picked to highlight police officers whose complaints were not substantiated in a disproportionate number of their complaints (especially Raman).</p>
<ul><li>Color scheme 0</li></ul>
<p>By picking red and orange for exoneration and unsubstantiated claims, it is implied that these are bad outcomes, without any acknowledgement that the complaints could have been invalid. As well, choosing gray for substantiated takes away the emphasis that any complaints are “validated”.</p>
<ul><li>Substantiated at bottom 1</li></ul>
<p>Leaving substantiated at the bottom in a seeming flat line can create some confusion but also seems to imply that officers all receive a baseline number of complaints that are valid.</p>
<h1 id="conclusionreflection">Conclusion/Reflection</h1>

<p>Overall, I was relatively disappointed with my ability to display the data in a way I wanted to. Tableau felt rather limiting in my ability to be creative and my attempts to use excel and ggplot in R were even less successful. That said, I did appreciate how simply I was able to show almost the exact same graph and elicit 2 almost opposite conclusions. Ethical analysis and visualization is very subjective and ultimately should rely upon the author to give as much unbiased context/info on the data as possible. In this case, it felt possible that even the publisher of the data was somewhat leading in their notes on the data. My conclusion is that the most important pieces of a graph (and where the most biases can lie) are in any accompanying text. By putting a large, leading title on top of a graph, you’re able to effectively push readers towards a predetermined conclusion that may be completely different from what the data should show.</p>
